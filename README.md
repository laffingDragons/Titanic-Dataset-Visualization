# Titanic Dataset Visualization

This Jupyter Notebook provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of the Titanic dataset. The analysis includes graphical representations of various features to understand passenger demographics, survival rates, and other key insights.

## Features
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Importing the Titanic dataset and handling missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarizing dataset characteristics.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate insightful plots.
- **Survival Analysis**: Investigating survival rates based on factors such as class, age, gender, and fare.
- **Correlations & Trends**: Identifying key relationships between different features.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Data_Visualization_Titanic_Dataset.ipynb
```
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to visualize and analyze the dataset.

## Dataset
This notebook uses the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) or the `Seaborn` library.

## Visualizations Included
- Bar charts for categorical variables (e.g., survival rate by class, gender, and embarkation point)
- Histograms and KDE plots for numerical variables (e.g., age and fare distributions)
- Box plots to explore outliers
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis

## Author
This notebook was created as part of an effort to master data visualization techniques for exploratory data analysis.
